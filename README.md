<h2>Convert regular grammar to Finite Automaton (FA)</h2>

<h3>For the formal grammar G=(VN, VT, P, S) need be obtained five strings, that belong to the language L(G), that is generated by this grammar. The length of strings must be no lesser than the number of characters from the alphabet VN+2.  </h3>

<h3>For each string build the noninverted (derivation) tree and derivation table.</h3>

<h3>Using Finite Automaton (FA) check if some input string is accepted by FA  (meaning you could generate that string by traversing FA) </h3>
<h3>Determine the grammar type by the Chromsky classification.</h3>
The grammar that is used for this program is of type 3 right linear grammar  because its productions are of the form: 
B ->aC  
B ->b
